Jansson's cartoon, they see a resemblance, yet it's you who

Enchanted me, so eerily elegant that I fainted.

Sienna scintillations from your straight silky hair,

Spellbinding, more than any strand Tizian ever painted.

<br>

In the valley, by the river, in the foothills,

Crikey, you are seen everywhere.

An intellect as forward as Ida Ward, as strong as Lilias Armstrong,

Oh how I adore you, my fair.

<br>

Multicultural and versatile, yet

Authentic, not adorned to the slightest.

EB's spider, rather you are like,

The taciturn, hidden in plain sight but nonetheless the brightest.

--------------------------------------------------------

An affluent boy went to England,

Left his poor mates behind in wasteland.

Vain boy calling vanity out,

I want to whack you with a big fat trout;

No one wants to hear your credentials, my friend.
