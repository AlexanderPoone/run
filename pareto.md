Elon Musk fired most Twitter employees. He couldn't be more correct. Notice that Twitter is a western firm.

20-80, individualist societies with star players like Ronaldo or Messi

25-75, real collectivist societies like Japan

0.001-100, the rest is history

0.001-100 for a giant beanstalk, or vines in a rainforest.

There is a country where the society is what we called a 'chaos-harmony lattice' in anthropology. A lattice of ripple-like concentric circles that swell and contract abruptly. If you view from the outer space, it looks a 'strong and stable' lattice. The devil is in the details. Foreigners seldom observe the dyads. Bus drivers 'struggled' (this word cannot be apter and it reminds me of a book by a bad Austrian painter) to tarnish each other's names. A valiant struggle indeed.

Creation is an incomplete process per Irenaeus. It is time to admit the fact that some people have no qualities at all. Sad but true, not everyone is born useful. You can't make a circle square.

It is not merely a lack of ability, but taking imcompetence for granted. These people have lived in the rainforest for so long that they refuse to work. Usually they are found swinging their genitals like a helicopter rotor. These humanoids are as viscous as treacle in a cauldron.

In some places, a book can be judged by its cover. Their 'up to no good' visages, avoidance of eye contact, and perhaps their 'creative' 'English' names or absence of one in the business world. The West is deluded to think that their theories and sayings apply everywhere, and deluded to call every social norm a 'culture' that needs to be respected.

In some places, the 'literati' read everything literally.
