It is not merely a lack of ability, but taking imcompetence for granted. These humanoids are as viscous as treacle in a cauldron.

In some places, a book can be judged by its cover. Their 'up to no good' visages, avoidance of eye contact, and perhaps their 'English' names or absence of one. The West is deluded to think that their theories and sayings apply everywhere, and deluded to call every social norm a 'culture' that needs to be respected.
